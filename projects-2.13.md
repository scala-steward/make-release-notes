**We no longer maintain lists of 2.13 libraries.**

Now that the Scala 2.13.x series is no longer new, the lists that formerly appeared here are no longer maintained. (You can still [view the last version](https://github.com/scala/make-release-notes/blob/2871718a2a650a0585e8f34225d454c3d305f4f8/projects-2.13.md) if you like.)

For current information, consult other sources such as [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org) and [search.maven.org](https://search.maven.org).
